                                 Project Statement: Huntington's Disease Progression Analysis

1. Problem Statement

Huntington's Disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. Clinicians often face challenges in accurately predicting the rate of disease progression, the onset of severe motor symptoms (Chorea), and the decline in functional capacity based solely on initial genetic markers. There is a need for a data-driven approach to correlate genetic factors (like CAG repeat length) with clinical outcomes (brain volume loss, motor symptoms) to assist in personalized care planning.


2. Scope of the Project

This project aims to develop a suite of Machine Learning models to analyze a comprehensive dataset of HD patients.

Input: Patient data including Age, Sex, HTT CAG Repeat Length, Brain Volume Loss, and Protein Aggregation Levels.

Processing: Data cleaning, label encoding for categorical symptoms, normalization of clinical metrics, and training of supervised/unsupervised models.

Output: Predictive insights including Disease Stage classification, Functional Capacity estimation, and patient clustering profiles.


3. Target Users

Neurologists & Clinicians: To validate diagnoses and estimate disease progression timelines.

Genetic Counselors: To visualize the relationship between CAG repeat lengths and symptom severity.

Medical Researchers: To identify patterns in protein aggregation and gene expression levels.


4. High-Level Features

Disease Stage Classification: Automatically categorizes patients into Early, Middle, or Late stages based on physiological data.

Symptom Severity Prediction: Estimates specific scores for Chorea and Functional Capacity to monitor quality of life.

Risk Factor Analysis: Identifies key drivers of neurological decline (e.g., determining if Brain Volume Loss is a stronger predictor than Age).

Patient Clustering: Groups patients with similar genetic profiles to discover subtypes of disease manifestation.
